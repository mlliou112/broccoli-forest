### A Classic

Cream of Tomato soup is a classic which I enjoy having in the restaurants, so I
thought it well worth while to perfect a homemade version myself. I opted for
using pre-stewed canned tomatoes in this recipe for convenience, and fat-free
cream cheese to make it slightly healthier. *Side rant: Why is it so difficult
to find canned tomatoes without any added salt? I find that any pre-salted
tomatoes are WAY too salty, and ruin the taste of any recipe. Of all the types
of canned tomatoes, there are only a few with no added salt. Shop carefully!*

### Secrets to a Good Tomato Soup

Tomatoes are fairly acidic, checking in with a ph of around 4.5. Since there
are lots of tomatoes in this recipe, in order to neutralize the acidity of the
tomatoes, the recipe calls for a small amount of either honey or baking soda,
which will act as a buffer to stabilize the ph. This tip is also helpful for
other acidic things like tea! I always add a small dash of baking soda whenever
I make sweet tea because it makes the tea less acidic and "smoother".

### Retrospective thoughts

Overall the soup was pretty delicious, but ended up a little too creamy for my
taste. Next time I will probably cut the amount of cream cheese in half. The
recipe book also lists a number of variations of cream of tomato, one of which
adds potatoes and substitutes the cream cheese for milk, which I'm definitely
excited to try. I'll probably make this recipe again in the summer when it's
tomato season, and I will stew my own tomatoes!
