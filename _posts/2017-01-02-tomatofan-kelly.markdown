This recipe first caught my eye because it was reminiscent of a recipe for
hasselback potatoes (look 'em up, they're super fun looking) that I found over
the summer-- except this time, it was layers of tomato, avocado, and hard
boiled egg topped with a creamy mustard dressing. A fantastic, aesthetically
pleasing way to plate food! However, I'll admit I was pretty hungry so this
time around I slopped together the tomato, avocado, and egg into a questionable
mush, but the flavors were there! 

What confused me came next. The creamy mustard dressing called for white wine
(perfect! leftover from my veggie soup and weekend libations), olive oil, half
and half, mustard, and a few spices. The wine and half and half didn't sit too
well in my stomach-- perhaps the root cause is that I'm not a fan of white wine
in my food, or there are some fancy cooking techniques and flavor combinations
that I have yet to master. The dressing itself was also very runny, seeping
right off the tomato fan without letting any of the flavor soak in. 

TL;DR Tomato fan was pretty tasty (I like all three ingredients individually,
they only get better when combined!), but I might consider a new dressing. Or
one with a thicker, creamier consistency. I'm in 100%! Not just that half and
half ;)
