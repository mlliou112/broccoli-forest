### I love quiche!

Quiche is love. Quiche is life. Yum. Quiche is one of my favorite foods to
order at a brunch place. There's something wonderful about the combination of a
flaky crust, creamy egg, and soft cheese. I would say my favorite quiche is one
with spinach and ham, but since this is a vegetarian cookbook and I had
leftover vegetables from soup, this quiche is made from just those vegetable
leftovers.

There are a few technicalities to making a good quiche. First, the crust has to
be crisp and flaky. Next, the ratio of egg to milk/cream for the filling has to
be just right. Finally, you should be careful not to leave the quiche in the
oven for too long. I would say this is a success for my first quiche, but
there's still a ways to go before calling it perfect. Next time I'll probably
pre-bake the crust to make it crispier, and increase the egg ratio for the
filling. It was a little too much creamy for my taste this time around.

I'll definitely be trying this again! I was quite surprised at how easy making
a quiche was, especially with a homemade crust. Quiche does not require very
many ingredients at all, mostly just flour, butter, milk and eggs - all things
I would have around the house anyway. Onwards to the perfect quiche!
