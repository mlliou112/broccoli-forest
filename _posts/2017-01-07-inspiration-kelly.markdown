After an early Saturday morning of ice skating, I invited some friends over for
brunch-- soup and inspiration! Immediately, the sauce from simmering the jar of
marinated artichoke heart juice, butter, and onion wafted a warm, rich smell
across the kitchen. I threw in the veggies (celery, mushrooms, potatoes, peas,
spinach, artichoke hearts) and let the soup simmer while playing an intense
round of Go Fish. 

I'm not sure what they put in that jar of marinated artichoke hearts (which was
also surprisingly easy to find in the store), but it sure was tasty! The jar
says "quartered artichoke hearts, water, veggie oil, vinegar, salt, *spices*".
Seems easy enough, except for the elusive spices. Online recipes seems to
recommend everything from italian seasoning to bay leaves to red chili flakes.
Sounds like an opportunity to choose your own adventure ;)
