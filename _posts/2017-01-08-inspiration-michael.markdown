### New Ingredient!

I've never used jarred marinated articokes to cook anything before, but I was
pleseantly surprised by the flavor it adds to the soup. The liquid was first
drained from the jar and used to saut√© the onions along with some butter. Then,
after a myriad of spices and cooking the other vegetables, the last thing that
goes in before it is served are the artichokes, peas, spinach and milk. The artichokes
give a slightly sour taste to the soup, which contrasts nicely with its sweet
onion taste. I've long enjoyed soups with milk and cream in them too!

### Was I inspired?

Not really, but the soup sure did taste good!
