### Stuffed Fruit

The tomato fan was stuffed with alternating avocado and egg slices, atop a bed
of spinach, drizzled with creamy mustard dressing. This thing was a pain to
assemble. I'm also not a big fan of the dressing. Avocado and egg are not
things that like to be squished into tight spaces and the main components of
the dressing were olive oil, Dijon mustard and apple cider vinegar. The
original recipe called for white wine, but I feel like that taste is even
stronger than the vinegar. But alas, I'm quite proud of how the final product
turned out, even if the taste was mediocre.

This bit is mostly a presentation piece, the amount of work for the taste was
probably not worth it, but I may make this again one day for a party or
something.
