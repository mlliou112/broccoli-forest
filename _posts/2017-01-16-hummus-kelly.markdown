Standard hummus is a mix of chickpeas, sesame paste, lemon juice, and garlic.
Most hummus recipes vary in the amount of cumin and tahini (sesame paste) is
used. However, this recipe included a curious mixture that included chickpeas,
tahini, OJ, garlic, green onion, tamari, cider vinegar, and a crazy assortment
of spices (cumin had a much sweeter, floral scent than I remembered). Blended
together and voila! Hummus! I used it as a sandwich spread with a sprinkle of
sunflower seeds, and also in lieu of tomato sauce for pasta. I definitely
recommend trying it out as a pasta sauce-- creamy and flavorful, similar to a
traditional pasta sauce but also packed with protein. It helps alleviate the
parental concern over a meatless diet.
