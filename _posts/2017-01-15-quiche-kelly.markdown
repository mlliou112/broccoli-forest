This story begins in the store, without cookbook in hand, looking for my next
recipe. I gave Michael a ring. He had just tried out the vegetable quiche, and
kindly passed along the necessary ingredient list-- butter, flour, salt, milk,
eggs, veggies, and cheese. 

Fun fact: though often associated with the French, the quiche is actually
*German*, from the word "kuchen" meaning "cake".

Once home, I eagerly flipped through the cookbook in search of the quiche. I
somehow skipped past the page detailing the steps to make a basic pie/quiche
crust, and found myself on another page of oddities. Mashed potato crust, nut
crust, savory crumb crust, and spinach crust. With unfamiliar crust ingredients
like wheat germ, oats, and potatoes, I wondered why Michael left such crucial
ingredients out from the list! 

Scrounging for ingredients around the kitchen, I settled on the Savory Crumb
Crust--

* Whole wheat breadcrumbs
* Whole wheat flour
* Raw wheat germ
* Rolled oats
* Salt
* Basil and/or marjoram
* Melted butter

I was only missing the raw wheat germ, which can be substituted with whole
wheat flour that naturally contains wheat germ. I didn't have quite the right
ratio of ingredients, so I poured in the remaining panko breadcrumbs from my
pantry, a generous serving of whole wheat flour, oats, salt, marjoram (a sweet
smelling herb I discovered through this cookbook), and butter. I pre-baked the
crust before throwing in the filling of egg, milk, cheese, spinach, mushrooms,
and tomatoes. Very tasty! The crust was a little soggy (perhaps from my
haphazard ingredient ratios), but the seasonings were on pointe. Perhaps this
quiche shall be my next party trick!
