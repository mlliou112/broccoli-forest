Kicking off the new year with a new vegetable soup! Notable ingredients include
marjoram, dry white wine (the first Chardonnay I found in the store... though
online sources say the go-to cooking white wines are generally Pinot Grigio,
Sauvignon Blanc, and unoaked Chardonnay), and tamari (for which I substituted
in soy sauce; tamari is gluten free and is thicker and less salty). Although I
admit my skepticism with the addition of the wine and soy sauce, it did add a
particular fanciful flavor reminiscent of a memory I can't quite recall.

Zuppa Alla Pavese-- a version of this veggie soup ladled over a buttery slice
of garlic toast, raw egg, and a dash of parmesan. I was hoping the soup would
be hot enough to cook the egg (since I can't remember when I bought the eggs in
my fridge... even though they did not float in water, indicating that they're
still good)-- however, the egg remained in its jello-like form.

Now here's where I went a little off script. I microwaved the entire bowl,
soup, bread, egg, and all-- for approximately 2 minutes. Voila, a well cooked
egg!

Regardless of its journey through the microwave, the toast was still seeping
with soupy flavor and topped with a hearty assortment of veggies. A tasty
recipe, but perhaps next time a poached or fried egg on top would do the trick.
