### Stir Fry Sauces

If you've ever gone to a Mongolian grill restaurant, that last step of ladling
a number of sauces onto your creation at your discretion will be familiar to
you. In my mind, it's surprising how that random array of sauces I choose turn
out to taste pretty well together (well, most times). Anyway, that's how I felt
about this special sauce. There are lots of flavors mixed in including
pineapple juice, soy sauce, sesame oil and garlic. It looks pretty gross before
you mix it into the stir fry, but somehow in the end, the flavors seem to blend
with the vegetable medley quite well!

### More about the dish

The recipe book said you could use the sauce with most any vegetable stir fry,
but I'd definitely recommend throwing some potatoes and mushrooms into the mix.
These are two components that tend to soak up the flavor pretty well.
Otherwise, this is a pretty great recipe to get rid of any left over vegetables
in the fridge. Just serve over rice and you have quite fulfilling meal!
